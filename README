 * Implementation details
 *************************/

/* 
 * This section should contain the implementation details and a overview of the
 * results. 

 * You are required to provide a good README document including the
 * implementation details. In particular, you can use pseudocode to describe your
 * implementation details where necessary. However that does not mean to
 * copy/paste your C code. Specifically, you should explain details corresponding 
 * to (1) multiple pipelines (2) job control (3) logging (3) .c commands 
 * compilation and execution. We expect the design and implementation details to 
 * be at most 1-2 pages.  A plain textfile is encouraged. However, a pdf is acceptable. 
 * No other forms are permitted.

 * In case of lab is limited in some functionality, you should provide the
 * details to maximize your partial credit.

After the devil shell initializes it runs a loop to iterate through the list of jobs. The variable called job_head is the pointer to the first job in the sequence. 
The shell first checks for built-in commands:

cd: A simple change of directory. Implemented with chdir function
jobs: It first tries to reap any terminated job. Then it check for the statuses of 
the jobs and logs them into a .log file.
bg: Performs a standard error checking first for any possible error 
that might occur (e.g. wrong arguments, or job specified is wrong) and then continues
the job without seizing the tty.
fg: Performs a standard error checking first for any possible error 
that might occur (e.g. wrong arguments, or job specified is wrong)and then continues
the job seizing the tty and making the shell wait for the job to finish.

Note that a method 'logger' was created to log any informative message to a .log file
in order to troubleshoot the program. The logger accepts an unformatted string with 
its arguments along with the proper output format, such as STDERR_FILENO for errors or STDOUT_FILENO for regular messages.

If none of the build in commands corresponds to the current job, the dsh calls spawn_job.
It first iterates through the processes in the job and forks each of them for future
execution. On the child side, piping and output redirection is established (if necessary)
before executing the program. For piping, two pipes are used. The first is assumed to
be before the current process. If the process has a previous pipe, then the reading end
of the pipe is duped to the input of the process. If the process has a following pipe, 
the write end of the pipe is duped so the process direct its output to the pipe. If the 
process is the last process, it transfers the output of the pipe back to stdout.
